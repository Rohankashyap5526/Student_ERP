# Student_ERP
Developed a system to manage and store student data,  including certificates. Designed a user-friendly interface  using  Tkinter  with  various  functional  buttons.
The Student Management System is an essential tool for educational institutions to efficiently 
manage student records, streamline administrative tasks, and enhance overall organization. 
This Python program showcases a comprehensive Student Management System implemented 
through a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. 
Features: 
 User-Friendly Interface: The GUI provides an intuitive interface for administrators to 
interact with the system. It offers buttons for adding, searching, updating, showing, and 
deleting student records. 
 Real-Time Clock and Slider: The GUI includes a real-time clock display and a sliding 
text element, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience. 
 Student Records Display: A table view powered by the Treeview widget presents student 
records, including their IDs, names, contact information, and other essential details. 
 Data Entry and Update: Administrators can add new student records or update existing 
ones through a dedicated data entry form. The form includes fields for inputting the 
student's name, contact details, address, gender, and date of birth. 
 View Details: The system allows administrators to view detailed information about a 
student by clicking on a corresponding button in the student records table. 
 Data Validation: The program performs data validation to ensure that all required fields 
are filled out correctly before storing or updating student records. 
 MySQL Integration: The application integrates with a MySQL database to store and 
retrieve student records securely.
